Blender Addons
==============
This repository contains the various addons I have developed for Blender. While I will generally try to keep the addons stable and generic to all use cases, they are mostly developed to fill an automation gap in my own uses and are not under active development.

Issues
------
If you come across something that seems like a bug, please report it here. Make sure to follow these guidelines to ensure your report isn't closed as "Invalid":

* Make sure you are using the latest version of the particular addon. Old versions of addons are unsupported.
* Search to see if someone else has already reported the bug. Duplicate reports just slow down getting things fixed.
* Include steps to reproduce the issue in your report. Screenshots or videos may also prove helpful.

Feature Requests
----------------
Have an idea for a feature that would fit well in one of these addons? Awesome! File an issue and detail your idea. Keep it succinct and on-point, and only one feature per request, or it'll get closed as "Invalid". Then we'll discuss your idea some and decide whether to implement it or not. As these addons are not under active development, pull requests for new features are strongly encouraged.

Contributions
-------------
You're welcome to submit pull requests for additional functionality or bug fixes if you like. I'll certainly consider merging them, and am happy to discuss any implementation details or concerns.
